							Forecasts are important to decision-making and risk assessment in many
domains. Since current database systems do not provide integrated support
for forecasting, it is usually done outside the database system by specially
trained experts; using forecast models. However, integrating model-based
forecasting as a first-class citizen inside a DBMS speeds up the forecasting
process by avoiding exporting the data and by applying database-related
optimizations like reusing created forecast models. It especially allows
subsequent processing of forecast results inside the database. In this demo,
we present our prototype F2DB based on PostgreSQL, which allows for
transparent processing of forecast queries. Our system automatically takes
care of model maintenance if the underlying dataset changes. In addition, we
offer optimizations to save maintenance costs and increase accuracy by using
derivation schemes. Our approach reduces the required expert knowledge by
enabling arbitrary users to apply forecasting in a declarative way.
